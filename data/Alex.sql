-- Find all players in the database who played at Vanderbilt University.
-- Create a list showing each player’s first and last names as well as the total salary they earned in the major leagues.
-- Sort this list in descending order by the total salary earned. Which Vanderbilt player earned the most money in the majors?



-- Using the fielding table, group players into three groups based on their position:
-- label players with position OF as "Outfield", those with position "SS", "1B", "2B", and "3B" as "Infield", and those with position "P" or "C" as "Battery".
-- Determine the number of putouts made by each of these three groups in 2016.



-- Find the average number of strikeouts per game by decade since 1920.
-- Round the numbers you report to 2 decimal places. Do the same for home runs per game.
-- Do you see any trends?



-- Find the player who had the most success stealing bases in 2016, where success is measured as the percentage of stolen base attempts which are successful.
-- (A stolen base attempt results either in a stolen base or being caught stealing.) Consider only players who attempted at least 20 stolen bases.



-- From 1970 – 2016, what is the largest number of wins for a team that did not win the world series?
-- What is the smallest number of wins for a team that did win the world series?
-- Doing this will probably result in an unusually small number of wins for a world series champion – determine why this is the case.
-- Then redo your query, excluding the problem year. How often from 1970 – 2016 was it the case that a team with the most wins also won the world series?
-- What percentage of the time?



-- Using the attendance figures from the homegames table, find the teams and parks which had the top 5 average attendance per game in 2016
-- (where average attendance is defined as total attendance divided by number of games).
-- Only consider parks where there were at least 10 games played. Report the park name, team name, and average attendance. Repeat for the lowest 5 average attendance.



-- Which managers have won the TSN Manager of the Year award in both the National League (NL) and the American League (AL)?

-- Find all players who hit their career highest number of home runs in 2016.
-- Consider only players who have played in the league for at least 10 years, and who hit at least one home run in 2016.
-- Report the players' first and last names and the number of home runs they hit in 2016.



-- Is there any correlation between number of wins and team salary? Use data from 2000 and later to answer this question.
-- As you do this analysis, keep in mind that salaries across the whole league tend to increase together, so you may want to look on a year-by-year basis.



-- Does there appear to be any correlation between attendance at home games and number of wins?



-- Do teams that win the world series see a boost in attendance the following year? What about teams that made the playoffs?
-- Making the playoffs means either being a division winner or a wild card winner.



-- It is thought that since left-handed pitchers are more rare, causing batters to face them less often, that they are more effective.
-- Investigate this claim and present evidence to either support or dispute this claim.
-- First, determine just how rare left-handed pitchers are compared with right-handed pitchers. 
-- Are left-handed pitchers more likely to win the Cy Young Award? Are they more likely to make it into the hall of fame?
